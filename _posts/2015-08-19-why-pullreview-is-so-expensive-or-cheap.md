title: Why PullReview is so expensive or cheap?
---

As informed on the [pricing page](https://www.pullreview.com/site/plans),
the prices depends on the number of developers that will use PullReview. It does
not depend on the number of repositories neither the number of reviews. The
reason is simple: PullReview operation costs is due to the infrastructure
needed to do the review and store them. More reviews are done, more it needs
power and space. It is simple. The question is then, what triggers a review?
A commit made by a developer. So the review activity is directly linked to the
developer activity. That is why the price is linked to the number of developers.

For the price per developer, it has been mainly chosen according the added value
of PullReview, the market, and our operation costs. If you compare the price
with the minimum wage of a junior developer in US, it corresponds to one hour of
work. PullReview will spare you more than that, whatever your level.
