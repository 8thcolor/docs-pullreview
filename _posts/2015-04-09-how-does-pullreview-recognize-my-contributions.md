# How does PullReview recognize my contributions?

PullReview identifies the author by his/her email mentioned in commits. If that
email is known to GitHub, PullReview is able to make the link between you and
the email. You can set up your emails via the
[GitHub settings page](https://github.com/settings/emails). Once done, just
logout/login so that we can take that into account.

If you want to change the author's email mentioned in an old commit, it is
possible to do it with [a script](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/).
But this is a destructive action as it will rewrite all the repository history.
