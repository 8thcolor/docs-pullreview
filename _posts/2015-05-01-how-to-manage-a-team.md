---

If you are on a team plan and you are the team owner, you will be able to manage your team:

* you can add member to your team via the
  [team page](https://www.pullreview.com/settings/team).
* you can set up a common chat notification for the whole team via the
  [team page](https://www.pullreview.com/settings/team).
* you can pull reviews on a repository for the whole team via the
  [team page](https://www.pullreview.com/settings/team) or the
  [repository page](https://www.pullreview.com/settings/repositories) (first you
  need to set up for yourself).
